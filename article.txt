Mayor Hancock and City Officials Host Panel Discussion on Climate Action at Alliance Center

DENVER, Jan. 16, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Mayor Michael B. Hancock and city officials will participate in a panel discussion at The Alliance Center (TAC) on Jan. 17 from 5:30 to 7:30 p.m. The panel will discuss Denver's climate goals, and what residents can do to help support Denver's efforts to address climate change.

This event will launch TAC's Alliance for Climate Action initiative. The event is sold out, but will be livestreamed on The Alliance Center's website. The focus of the Alliance for Climate Action series is to drive action at the personal, community, and governmental levels to meet and exceed both Denver and Colorado's greenhouse gas reduction goals. The Alliance Center is launching the Alliance for Climate Action as part of their commitment to three main impact areas: our environment, our communities and our economy.  

Moderated by Clauton Mitchell, VP Facilities and Operations Kaiser Permanente, speakers will include:

Mayor Hancock
Thomas Herrod, Climate Program Manager, Denver Department of Public Health & Environment – Environmental Quality Division
Katrina Managan, Senior Advisor for Energy Efficiency, Denver Department of Public Health & Environment – Environmental Quality Division 
Crissy R. Fanganello, Director of Transportation & Mobility, Denver Public Works
"Denver has been a leader when it comes to taking action on climate change," Mayor Hancock said. "Our city was also among the earliest to adopt aggressive greenhouse gas reduction goals, and we are committed to continuing that work."

Mayor Hancock first announced Denver's goal to reduce GHG emissions 80 percent by 2050 (using a 2005 baseline) in 2015 at the Sustainable Denver Summit. The goal is part of the city's updated 2015 Climate Action Plan. 

Denver was also the fourth of 360+ cities to join what is now known as Climate Mayors, a collaborative of almost 400 mayors from across the country who have committed to uphold the Paris Agreement Goals.

Denver's climate goals are part of a larger question humanity faces: How do we meet the needs of all people while supporting a healthy and thriving planet? The Alliance Center is taking action today by helping reduce Denver's greenhouse gas emissions, supporting the transition to a clean energy economy, and scaling up individuals' and organizations' positive impacts. 

Furthermore, many of TAC's tenants have served on Denver Office of Sustainability advisory committees and many tenants work every day to achieve Denver's climate goals, positively affecting everything from energy efficiency to regional planning.
